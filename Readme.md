# 🚀 Project Overview

GoodFoods, a multi-location restaurant chain, requires an automated reservation system capable of understanding natural language queries, checking real-time availability, suggesting alternatives, and completing reservations. This solution integrates:

### ✔ A conversational agent that:

* Determines intent (search / book / cancel / feedback)
* Extracts fields from natural language (date, time, guests, area, restaurant names)
* Calls backend tools using MCP
* Handles complex fallback logic
* Provides human-quality conversational responses

### ✔ A backend that:

* Manages restaurants, tables, bookings, and feedback
* Computes availability with real-time conflict detection
* Supports geospatial search (nearest restaurants)
* Handles race conditions with DB-level locking

### ✔ A frontend that:

* Provides a clean chat UI
* Sends user messages to the FastAPI backend
* Displays AI responses dynamically

# 🔧 Setup Instructions

## 1️⃣ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

## 2️⃣ **Create virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

## 3️⃣ **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4️⃣ **Install & run Ollama**

Download from [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
Run:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2
```

## 5️⃣ **Configure environment**

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
MODEL="llama3.2"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./reservation.db"
```

## 6️⃣ **Start the backend**

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This automatically seeds the database with:

* 50 restaurants
* 10 users
* deterministic bookings
* feedback history

## 7️⃣ **Open the frontend**

Open `index.html` in any browser.

# ✨ Prompt Engineering Approach

The agent is built entirely using **manual prompt engineering**, without LangChain or libraries.
The system prompt contains:

### **1. Role & tone guidelines**

* Natural, friendly, no technical leakage
* Never reveal tools or backend logic
* Always explain availability in conversational manner

### **2. Strict tool-calling rules**

LLM must:

* Call tools using ONLY the JSON structure required
* Avoid adding unknown fields
* Continue reasoning after reading tool JSON

### **3. Action-driven architecture**

The prompt defines **4 high-level actions**:

1. Search availability
2. Make reservation
3. Cancel reservation
4. Submit feedback

Each action has 10–20 substeps with:

* Argument extraction rules
* Validation logic
* Fallback loops
* User preference matching
* Sentiment-based ranking logic
* Nearby restaurant ranking logic

### **4. Function modules inside systemic prompt**

The LLM is guided through:

* User preference extraction
* Restaurant ranking
* Similarity scoring
* Amenity/cuisine matching
* Likes/dislikes merging
* Good/bad reviews classification

### **5. Safety nets**

To avoid hallucination:

* **Never guess restaurant IDs**
* Only use IDs returned by tools
* Never invent cuisines or amenities
* Strict JSON tool call structure

This design ensures the assistant behaves like a deterministic, multi-step state machine while still generating natural conversation.

# 💬 Example Conversations (User Journeys)

### **Journey 1 — Search by area**

```
User: Find a table for 4 people in Adyar on Dec 1 at 7pm.
Assistant: (Extracts date, time, guests, area)
          (Runs availability search)
          Your preferred restaurant in Adyar is fully booked at 7 PM,
          but I found availability at 7:30 PM. Would that work for you?
```

### **Journey 2 — Strict slot -> fallback**

```
User: No, I need exactly 7 PM.
Assistant: I can check nearby restaurants within a few kilometers.
          Shall I look for alternatives close to Adyar?
```

### **Journey 3 — Selecting best match**

```
Assistant: Here are two options:
          - Nearest: GoodFoods Feast Adyar (0.4 km away)
          - Best Match: GoodFoods Delight Adyar (0.8 km away)
            This one matches your preference for outdoor seating and Indian cuisine.

          Would you like to book either of these?
```

### **Journey 4 — Booking**

```
User: Book the second one.
Assistant: Great! I will reserve a table for 4 at 7 PM.
          Please confirm before I proceed.
```

### **Journey 5 — Feedback submission**

```
User: I want to give feedback for my booking 12.
Assistant: Sure! Please share a rating from 1 to 5 and your comments.
```

# 📈 Business Strategy Summary

### **Core Business Problems Solved**

* High manual load on staff for reservation management
* Failure in capturing user preferences
* Low personalization compared to modern booking apps
* Lack of proactive fallback suggestions → lost revenue

### **Key Opportunities**

* Personalized experiences → higher customer retention
* Sentiment-driven ranking → promote high-rated branches
* Data-driven insights → identify weak-performing locations
* Ability to scale across multiple cities

### **Measurable Success Metrics**

| Metric                              | Target                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Reduced failed reservation attempts | **25–30%**              |
| Higher customer satisfaction        | **+20%**                |
| Reduction in manual calls           | **40%**                 |
| Faster booking time                 | < 15 seconds end-to-end |

### **Vertical Expansion**

* Hotel bookings
* Spa / salon reservations
* Event venue reservations
* Doctor appointments
* Multi-brand food court management

### **Competitive Advantages**

1. A fully deterministic multi-step LLM flow
2. Preference & sentiment-aware selection logic
3. Scalable tool-based architecture suitable for enterprise

---

# 🧩 Assumptions

* Only one user profile (User 1) is simulated
* Restaurants have fixed seating of 6 chairs per table
* Duration defaults to **2 hours** if not provided
* Nearby search radius = 10 km

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

### **Due to small local LLM (Llama 3.2 via Ollama):**

* Occasionally outputs raw JSON instead of human text
* Sometimes fails to trigger tool calls
* Occasionally leaks technical words (“tool”, “function”, etc.)
* Struggles with strict multi-action flow due to context compression

### **Other constraints**

* No real geospatial indexing (SQLite only)
* UI is simplistic and not production-grade
* No authentication layer

These limitations are known and expected for a project using a small local model.

---

# 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **LLM & Intelligence**

* Upgrade to larger Llama 3 / GPT-4.1 model for reliable multi-step tool calling
* Add RAG layer for restaurant FAQ, menus, policies
* Add voice interface

### **Backend**

* Migrate to PostgreSQL + PostGIS for real geospatial search
* Add Redis caching for availability lookups
* Add concurrency-safe double-booking prevention

### **Product Features**

* Multi-user accounts & login
* Loyalty points and reward system
* Table type preferences (window seat, indoor/outdoor, AC, etc.)
* Multi-language support
